      <h1>My Tech Journey</h1>
      <h4 id="intro">My journey into tech started with a desire to understand electronic devices, computers and the internet.
        I gained admission to study Electronic and Computer Engineering, I was always fascinated by how systems worked, but my passion extended beyond hardware. 
        I found myself drawn to software engineering, desiring to learn coding for digital innovations.
      </h4>

      <h4 id="p2">
        While studying, I began seeking ways to immerse myself in tech beyond the classroom. 
        I explored moderation and community management, gaining firsthand experience in the NFT and Web3 space. 
        This role helped me understand the power of online communities and how technology connects people globally.
        To expand my technical skills, I took the bold step of learning front-end development. 
        I started with HTML and CSS, learning about the building blocks of websites. 
      </h4>

    <h4>
      My dedication paid off when I won a scholarship for learn front-end development at Glovo Women in Tech Bootcamp, 
      an opportunity that accelerated my learning and deepened my love for software engineering.
       Determined to be skillful, I have also completed a Virtual Assistant and Customer Support course at Digital Witch, 
       equipping myself with skills for remote work and professional communication. 
       This training has prepared me for diverse opportunities in the digital space.
     </h4>

     <h4>
      My journey has not been without challenges. As a student, balancing academics and skill-building has been tough. 
      However, I have remained resilient, seeking scholarships and freelance opportunities to sustain my education. 
      One highlight was winning a giveaway, a small but encouraging reminder that persistence pays off.
     </h4>

      <h4>
       Now, I am on the path to mastering front-end development while continuing my studies in Electronics and Computer Engineering. 
       I have started mastering JavaScript, gaining more knowlegde in Software Engineering.
       I aspire to merge hardware and software technologies to create innovative solutions that make a difference.
